# ðŸ¤– Creating an AWS EBS Snapshot

## Introduction

Want to ensure your data is safe and recoverable in case of an issue? This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of creating and using Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) snapshots, providing you with the peace of mind that your data is securely backed up and can be restored when needed.

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to effectively create and use EBS snapshots, ensuring your data is securely backed up and easily recoverable. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin creating and using EBS snapshots, ensure you have the following:

+ **AWS Account:** A registered AWS account with permissions to manage EC2 instances and EBS volumes.

+ **Basic Knowledge of EC2 and EBS:** Familiarity with EC2 instances and EBS volumes.

+ **Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection to access the AWS Management Console.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you are ready to proceed with creating and using EBS snapshots.

## Steps ðŸ‘“:-

**Step 1** â€” Access the AWS Management Console

Open your web browser and navigate to the AWS Management Console: https://aws.amazon.com/console/

Sign in with your AWS account credentials.

**Step 2** â€” Navigate to EC2 Dashboard
